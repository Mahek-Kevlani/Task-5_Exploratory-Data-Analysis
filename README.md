Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in VS Code

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using a standalone Python script Python IDE.
The script loads the dataset, performs statistical analysis, and generates a variety of visualizations to extract insights about passenger survival patterns.

Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Dataset
Source: [Titanic Dataset - Direct Download (train.csv)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/titanic.csv)
The dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, such as:
- Passenger class
- Gender
- Age
- Fare paid
- Survival status

Features of the Script
- Loads dataset from a public GitHub URL (no download needed)
- Displays basic dataset info, null values, and descriptive statistics
- Generates the following visualizations:
  - Age and Fare distribution (histograms)
  - Age by class (boxplot)
  - Survival by gender (countplot)
  - Age vs. Fare colored by survival (scatterplot)
  - Correlation matrix (heatmap)
  - Pairplot of key features
